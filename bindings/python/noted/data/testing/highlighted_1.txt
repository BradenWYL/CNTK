The law is rarely out of the news. It frequently stimulates
controversy. #While lawyers and politicians celebrate the
virtues of the rule of law, reformers lament its shortcomings,
and cynics question its professed equivalence with justice.# Yet
#all# recognize the law as #a vehicle for social change#. And few
doubt #the central role# of law in our social, political, moral, and
#economic life#.
